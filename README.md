# Overview
- A simple card game to test your memorization and speed skills. Match all the cards before your time runs out and you win! You will have one minute to complete this task. Simply press the start button to begin! You'll select a card to turn over, then select a second card to turn over, if both cards are a match they stay face up. Guess wrong, and both cards will turn face down again. Keep repeating this process until all cards are matched!
